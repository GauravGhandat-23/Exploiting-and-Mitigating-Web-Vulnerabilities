# Exploiting and Mitigating Web Vulnerabilities

### Overview
This repository contains a **Cybersecurity Minor Project** focused on understanding, exploiting, and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. The project includes a hands-on demonstration of an attack that bypasses login authentication and emphasizes best practices for securing applications against such threats.

## Repository Title
**Exploiting-and-Mitigating-Web-Vulnerabilities**

---

## Problem Statement
The project addresses an SQL injection vulnerability in the login function of a web application. The goal is to demonstrate how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to log in as an administrator without valid credentials and to highlight preventative measures to mitigate such risks.

---

## Objectives
1. Exploit a vulnerable application's login functionality to bypass authentication using SQL injection.
2. Understand the mechanics of SQL injection attacks.
3. Learn best practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

## Prerequisites
- Access to a vulnerable web application's login page.
- Knowledge of SQL queries and injection techniques.

---

## Steps to Reproduce the Attack
1. Navigate to the **Login Page** of the vulnerable application.
2. Identify the input fields for:
   - Username
   - Password
3. Inject the SQL payload:
   ```sql
      administrator'--
- Enter the above payload in the username field.
- Leave the password field empty or input any value (ignored by the query).
4. Submit the form to bypass authentication.
5. **Expected Outcome**: Successful login as the administrator, granting access to admin functionalities.

---

## Explanation of the Payload
- **`administrator'--`**:
- The `'` closes the username string in the query.
- `--` is an SQL comment operator, ignoring the rest of the query, including the password condition.

---

## Sample Queries
- **Before Injection**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user_input' AND password = 'user_password';
- **After Injection**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = '';

---

## Prevention Strategies
To prevent SQL injection attacks and secure web applications:

1. Use Prepared Statements: Ensure all SQL queries are parameterized and do not directly include user input.
2. Validate and Sanitize Inputs: Restrict input types and remove any potentially harmful characters.
3. Role-Based Access Control: Limit user privileges to reduce the impact of a successful attack.
4. Regular Security Audits: Regularly test applications for vulnerabilities.
5. Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): Protect against common injection attacks.

---

## Tools and Resources Used

- Vulnerable web application (for demonstration purposes).
- Web browser for accessing the application.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the severe risks posed by SQL injection vulnerabilities and the importance of securing web applications against such attacks. By simulating an attack and proposing mitigation strategies, this project provides a practical foundation for enhancing web application security.
