# Exploiting and Mitigating Web Vulnerabilities

### Overview
This repository contains a **Cybersecurity Minor Project** focused on understanding, exploiting, and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. The project includes a hands-on demonstration of an attack that bypasses login authentication and emphasizes best practices for securing applications against such threats.

## Repository Title
**Exploiting-and-Mitigating-Web-Vulnerabilities**

---

## Problem Statement
The project addresses an SQL injection vulnerability in the login function of a web application. The goal is to demonstrate how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to log in as an administrator without valid credentials and to highlight preventative measures to mitigate such risks.

---

## Objectives
1. Exploit a vulnerable application's login functionality to bypass authentication using SQL injection.
2. Understand the mechanics of SQL injection attacks.
3. Learn best practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

## Prerequisites
- Access to a vulnerable web application's login page.
- Knowledge of SQL queries and injection techniques.

---

## Steps to Reproduce the Attack
1. Navigate to the **Login Page** of the vulnerable application.
2. Identify the input fields for:
   - Username
   - Password
3. Inject the SQL payload:
```sql
administrator';
   - Enter the above payload in the username field.
   - Leave the password field empty or input any value (ignored by the query).
4. Submit the form to bypass authentication.
5. **Expected Outcome**: Successful login as the administrator, granting access to admin functionalities.

---

## Explanation of the Payload
- **`administrator'--`**:
- The `'` closes the username string in the query.
- `--` is an SQL comment operator, ignoring the rest of the query, including the password condition.

---

## Sample Queries
- **Before Injection**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user_input' AND password = 'user_password';
