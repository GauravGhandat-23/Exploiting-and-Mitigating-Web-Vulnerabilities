# Exploiting-and-Mitigating-Web-Vulnerabilities

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates two critical vulnerabilities in web applications:
1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
2. SQL Injection for login bypass.

## Objectives
- Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Understand the impact of security flaws and learn mitigation techniques.

### Task 1: Reflected XSS Vulnerability

#### Problem Statement
Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded. This vulnerability exists in the search functionality of a web application, allowing attackers to execute JavaScript code in the user's browser.

#### Steps to Exploit
1. **Access the Web Application:** Open the webpage containing the search functionality.
2. **Test the Search Field for Reflection:** Enter a string (e.g., `test`) to check if it is reflected.
3. **Craft an XSS Payload:** Inject the following payload:
   ```html
   <script>alert(1)</script>
   ```
4. **Submit the Payload:** Observe if a popup with "1" appears.

#### Mitigation Recommendations
- Validate and sanitize user inputs.
- Apply context-appropriate encoding.
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Use security libraries like OWASP AntiSamy.

### Task 2: SQL Injection for Login Bypass

#### Problem Statement
This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and log in as an administrator by injecting SQL commands into the username field.

#### Steps to Exploit
1. **Navigate to the Login Page:** Locate the username and password fields.
2. **Inject SQL Payload:** In the username field, enter:
   ```sql
   administrator'--
   ```
   Leave the password field empty or provide any value.
3. **Submit the Form:** Observe if access is granted to the administrator account.

#### Explanation of Payload
- `administrator'`: Ends the current string.
- `--`: Comments out the rest of the SQL query, bypassing password validation.

#### Mitigation Recommendations
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.
- Validate and sanitize user inputs.
- Restrict user privileges.
